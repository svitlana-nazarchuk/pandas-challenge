I noticed that:

1. The optimal spending per students are in range $585-$615. When schools spend more, test results are not getting better
2. Charters schools are better than district schools by math and reading scores and overall passing rate
3. Small and Medium schools (<2000 students) shows better results than larger schools(2000-5000)
